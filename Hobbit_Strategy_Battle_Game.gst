      <description>A banner provides a single re-roll to friendly models who are involved in a Fight within 3&quot;. Whether it is a model fighting on his own, or several friends all fighting against a common enemy, you can re-roll one Duel roll die in each Fight to see who wins. This re-roll can be made after your opponent has rolled his own dice to see who wins, but must be made before any Might points are spent to adjust scores.

It is possible that one player may re-roll a die and find himself winner the Fight - in which case his opponent may wish to use a banner of his own. Remember, a banner only provides one re-roll to each Duel roll.

Any model carrying a banner is encumbered by its weight, and suffers a -1 penalty to his Duel rolls.

A warrior carrying a banner who is clain may pass it on to a friendly Warrior (but not to a Hero), who is in base contact and is not engaged ina Fight. Swap the models over, or finr a suitable banner-carrying substiture in your collection.</description>

Models armed with Elven blades are more likely to win the dice roll to see who wins a Drawn Combat. A Good model with an Elven blade will win the roll off on a 3-6 instead of a 4-6. Should an Evil model have the Elven blade (an odd situation, granted) he will win the roll on a 1-4. If both sides have Elven blades, neither receives an advantage.</description>

Just as with a spear-armed model, this created an exception to the ordinary Fight rules, in that the bearer does not need to be in bast contact with an enemy modell.</description>

      <description>Prior to either player rolling any dice in a Duel roll, a shield-armed model who is involved in te Fight may declare that he is Shielding. A model that is Shielding doucles his Attacks when making the Duel roll to see who wins the Fight. Thus, a Shielding model with 1 Attack would roll two dice. If the Shielding model wins the Fight, however, he makes no striked against his enemy, having put all of his effort into surviving.

In a Multiple Combat, all friendly models in the same Fight must be Shielding for them to get the bonus. Thus, if one or more friendly models do not have shie;ds, then none of them can use the Shielding rule. Spear- and pike - armed models cannot Support a Shielding model.

Models who are Prone can use the Shielding rule like other fighters.</description>

      <description>A spear enables its bearer to fight in a special way. A spear-armed model can join a Fight by moving into base contact with a friend who is in base contact with an enemy model. This is an exception to the ordinary Fight rules, in that the spear-armed model does not need to be in base contact with the enemy model to participate in the Fight.

A spear-armed model fighting in thie way contributes a single Attack to the Fight, at his own Fight value and using his own Strength characteristic, provided he is not himself in base contact with an enemy model. He may only contribute a single Attack, however, regardless of how many he has on his profile. If the spear-armed model is a Hero with Might points, he may expend them to affect his dice in the usual way. In a Multiple Combat, a supporting model he is supporting.

The model using the spear is considered to be suppoting his ally, and may not be targeted with Strikes should his side lose the combat; he will also not be Knocked to the Ground if his side loses the Fight against a charging Cavalry model.

A model can only gain Support from one spear-armed model at a time and a spear-armed model may only Support a single model at a time. A spear-armed model can Support any friendly model, even one that is Prone or armed with a two-handed weapon.

Supporting models may not use Heroic Actions in the Fight phase, not can they make additional moves as part of a Heroic Combat.

A spear-armed model may Make Way for his ally if they lose the Fight. This counts as the one model who is allowed to Make Way for a friend.</description>

      <description>A model with a throwing weapon can shoot with it in the shoot phase, even if he has moved more than half of his maximum move distance. A model cannot fight with a throwing weapon in the Fight phase.

A throwing weapon can be used as its bearer charges into combat. The player moves the model as if it were going to Charge the enemy, but instead of moving into base combat with his foe, he stops 1&quot; away. He then throws the weapon at the enemy he is about to Charge. This shot is resolved using the rules for shooting (including the -1 To Hit penalty for moving), even though it takes place in the Move phase.

If the target is not slain, the charger then moves into base contact with the same enemy model. If the original target is slain, the charger may complete his move in any way the controlling player wishes - stopping straight away, charging another target or anything in between.</description>

Siege Engines that have a Troll crew member may fire twice each turn provided that the Troll is in base contact with the Siege Engine, has not moved in the preceding Move phase and is not engaged in combat. The Troll does not count towards the mnimum number of crew required to operate the maching, so you must have at least two other crew present. Troll crew carry a hand weapon (not that they really need one to fight effectively). Only a single Mordor Troll can be attached to Siege Engine.</description>
