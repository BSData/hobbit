      <description>A banner provides a single re-roll to friendly models who are involved in a Fight within 3&quot;. Whether it is a model fighting on his own, or several friends all fighting against a common enemy, you can re-roll one Duel roll die in each Fight to see who wins. This re-roll can be made after your opponent has rolled his own dice to see who wins, but must be made before any Might points are spent to adjust scores.

It is possible that one player may re-roll a die and find himself winner the Fight - in which case his opponent may wish to use a banner of his own. Remember, a banner only provides one re-roll to each Duel roll.

Any model carrying a banner is encumbered by its weight, and suffers a -1 penalty to his Duel rolls.

A warrior carrying a banner who is clain may pass it on to a friendly Warrior (but not to a Hero), who is in base contact and is not engaged ina Fight. Swap the models over, or finr a suitable banner-carrying substiture in your collection.</description>

Models armed with Elven blades are more likely to win the dice roll to see who wins a Drawn Combat. A Good model with an Elven blade will win the roll off on a 3-6 instead of a 4-6. Should an Evil model have the Elven blade (an odd situation, granted) he will win the roll on a 1-4. If both sides have Elven blades, neither receives an advantage.</description>

      <description>Pikes require two hands to use. This means that a model cannot use a shield and a pike at the same time. Otherwise, the rules for pikes are the same as those spears with the following exceptions. A pike-srmed model can Support a friend engaged in close combat by being in base combat with another pike-armed model that is already doing so (note they must both be pikes; neither can be a spear), so two pike-armed models can Support one comrade. Just as with a spear-armed model, this created an exception to the ordinary Fight rules, in that the bearer does not need to be in bast contact with an enemy modell.</description>

      <description>Prior to either player rolling any dice in a Duel roll, a shield-armed model who is involved in te Fight may declare that he is Shielding. A model that is Shielding doucles his Attacks when making the Duel roll to see who wins the Fight. Thus, a Shielding model with 1 Attack would roll two dice. If the Shielding model wins the Fight, however, he makes no striked against his enemy, having put all of his effort into surviving.

In a Multiple Combat, all friendly models in the same Fight must be Shielding for them to get the bonus. Thus, if one or more friendly models do not have shie;ds, then none of them can use the Shielding rule. Spear- and pike - armed models cannot Support a Shielding model.

Models who are Prone can use the Shielding rule like other fighters.</description>

      <description>A spear enables its bearer to fight in a special way. A spear-armed model can join a Fight by moving into base contact with a friend who is in base contact with an enemy model. This is an exception to the ordinary Fight rules, in that the spear-armed model does not need to be in base contact with the enemy model to participate in the Fight.

A spear-armed model fighting in thie way contributes a single Attack to the Fight, at his own Fight value and using his own Strength characteristic, provided he is not himself in base contact with an enemy model. He may only contribute a single Attack, however, regardless of how many he has on his profile. If the spear-armed model is a Hero with Might points, he may expend them to affect his dice in the usual way. In a Multiple Combat, a supporting model he is supporting.

The model using the spear is considered to be suppoting his ally, and may not be targeted with Strikes should his side lose the combat; he will also not be Knocked to the Ground if his side loses the Fight against a charging Cavalry model.

A model can only gain Support from one spear-armed model at a time and a spear-armed model may only Support a single model at a time. A spear-armed model can Support any friendly model, even one that is Prone or armed with a two-handed weapon.

Supporting models may not use Heroic Actions in the Fight phase, not can they make additional moves as part of a Heroic Combat.

A spear-armed model may Make Way for his ally if they lose the Fight. This counts as the one model who is allowed to Make Way for a friend.</description>

A throwing weapon can be used as its bearer charges into combat.

This shot is resolved using the rules for shooting (including the -1 To Hit penalty for moving), even though it takes place in the Move phase.

For the Drum to be struck, at least one Drummer must start the turn in base contact with it and must not move or be engaged in combat. It may not be moved and played in the same turn. If one or more Drums meet these conditions, then the following effects apply: All fights within 18&quot;/42cm of one or more struck Drums that include at least one Moria Goblin, the Evil player can re-roll any one of the dice he rolled when determining who wins the fight. You must stick with the result of the re- roll (dice cannot be re-rolled more than once).

All Moria Goblins on the battlefield (including Heroes) add +1 to their Courage values and all Good models on the battlefield suffer a -1 penalty to their Courage values (note that this is not cumulative with other rules that confer similar modifiers).

For the purposes of counting the total number of models in the Evil force, only the Drummers count and not the Drum itself.

      <description>When you deploy your army, do not place the Watcher in the Water on the board - instead keep it to one side ready for use later in the game. At the start of each turn, before rolling for priority, announce if you would like the Watcher to arrive, and then roll a D6. On the score of a 3+ it is ready to enter play. Once you have declared that you would fire the Watcher to arrive, you must roII at the start of each turn thereafter until it is available.

When the Watcher is ready to enter play, immediately place it anywhere on the battlefield - it can displace models. Move any displaced miniatures by the shortest possible distance so that they are 1&quot;/2cm away from the Watcher (or as close as space will allow). In this situation, players take it in turns to reposition his own displaced models, with the player that controls the Watcher in the Water going first. This may create some strange situations, but represents the Watcher bursting up from below the ground and scattering warriors (friend and foe alike) with its shocking arrival and incredible bulk.

If the Cave Drake chooses to swallow a model, make a single roll To Wound against the target - if successful, the victim is gobbled up and very dead.

Fate rolls can be made against this special attack as normal. If the Fate roll is passed, the target survives and is unharmed. If the Fate roll is failed, the target model loses any remaining Wounds and is removed as a casualty.

Cave Drakes are almost continuously hungry and wonât hesitate to consume a morsel of flesh in the midst of a battle. Using its powerful jaws, a Cave Drake can crunch armour and bone, choking down a man-sized victim in a matter of moments.</description>

      <description>The Drum can be shot at normally by the Good side, and has a Defence of 10 and 3 Wounds. If reduced to 0 Wounds, the model is destroyed - leave the Drum in place - but it cannot be played any more. The Drum model has no control zone and if a Good model spends a full turn in base contact with the Drum, without doing anything else (such as shooting, using magical powers or fighting in combat), the Drum is automatically destroyed as described above.</description>

      <description>Occasionally a model may carry no weapon at all. and when this is the case it will be clearly specified in its entry.

An unarmed model is not well equipped for combat and therefore suffers a -l dice penalty when working out who wins a fight - a roll of 4 counts as 3. a roll of 6 as 5, and so on. Rolls of 1 still count as 1 because it is the lowest score possible. Note that separate dice rolls will be required in multiple combats for unarmed models.

Savage animals and monsters which would not normally need weapons to fight are not penalised just because they have no visible weaponry. They have claws. teeth, and whatever else nature has endowed them with.</description>
